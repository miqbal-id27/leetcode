id is the column with unique values for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who traveled the distance "distance".
 

Write a solution to report the distance traveled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by travelled_distance in descending order, if two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
