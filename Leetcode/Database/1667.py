## 1667. Fix Names in a Table
## https://leetcode.com/problems/fix-names-in-a-table/description/

"""
Table: Users

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of one user.
 

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
| 3       | charLIE |
| 4       | dANIEL |
+---------+-------+
Output: 
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
| 3       | Charlie |
| 4       | Daniel |
+---------+-------+
Explanation: 
Only the first character is uppercase, and all others are lowercase.
